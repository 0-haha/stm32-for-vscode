# Configuration file for the STM32 for VSCode extension
# This configuration is generated when the STM32 for VSCode extension is used for building a project.
# This will only happen once and the contents will remain static unless changed by the user.

# Arrays can be inputted in two ways. One is: [entry_1, entry_2, ..., entry_final]
# or by adding an indented list below the variable name e.g.:
# VARIABLE:
# - entry_1
# - entry_2

# The project name
target: test_firmware
# Can be C or C++
language: C
